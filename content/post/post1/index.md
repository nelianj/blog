I've had a quite full schedule this past week. I made sure to attend all my classes, complete all my assignments and put in effort to study, staying true to my academic goals.It was also an exciting time because I had my first day working at KFC, stepping into a new role and starting a fresh journey in the workforce. Balancing work and studies, I managed to squeeze in a visit to the Red Square, adding a touch of exploration to my busy week. Overall, it was a week of learning, working and a bit of adventure, a mix that keeps life interesting.
