## About Version Control

What is ‚Äúversion control‚Äù, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

## Here's how Git, a popular version control system, works:

1. Repository: Git operates within a repository, a directory where all the files and historical data for the project are stored.

2. Commits: Developers make changes to files in the repository and create commits to save these changes. Each commit has a unique identifier, a timestamp, and the author's information.

3. Branching: Git allows for branching, enabling developers to work on different features or fixes independently. Branches are separate lines of development that can be merged back together later.

4. Merging: When a feature is ready, developers merge the changes from one branch (e.g., a feature branch) back into another (e.g., the main branch) to integrate the new code.

5. Remote Repositories: Git also supports remote repositories, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project and synchronize their changes.

6. Conflict Resolution: If two developers make conflicting changes to the same file, Git helps in resolving these conflicts by highlighting the differences and requiring manual intervention to decide how to proceed.

In essence, version control systems like Git provide a structured way to manage code changes, collaborate efficiently, maintain a history of modifications, and ensure project integrity in software development.
