My week was not all that, it was I can say a calm week. Off course, me being a student,I had to attend all my classes and complete all my assignments.This past week I only went to work twice, that's yesterday and today. I thought balancing work and studies will be a piece of cake but it's actually exhausting and no longer fun. The positive thing is that you gain alot of skills while working that they don't teach everything in school such as time management and other important skills that will help you later in life. You can say my week was pretty boring, nothing fun happened. Thanks for reading.
