Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to create formatted documents. It is commonly used for formatting readme files, documentation, messages in online forums, and is supported by many platforms and tools, such as GitHub, Reddit, and various content management systems.

Markdown is designed to be easy to read and write in plain text, but at the same time, it can be converted into HTML for online display. It uses simple symbols and conventions to indicate various text formatting elements such as headings, bold and italic text, lists, links, and images.

Some common elements in Markdown syntax include:
- '#' for headers (e.g., # Heading 1, ## Heading 2)
- '*' or '_' for emphasis (e.g., *italic*, **bold**)
- Lists using '*', '+', or '-' for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists
- Links ([Link Text](url)) and images (![Alt Text](url)) formatting
- Blockquotes using '>' symbol 
- Code blocks using backticks (\`)

Markdown provides a convenient way to format text without the need for complex HTML coding, making it popular for quick and efficient document creation, especially for creating content for the web that requires basic formatting.
